      <License>
        &lt;p style='font-size:11.5pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:center'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sitecore License Agreement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;LICENSEE’S USE OF THE SITECORE SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO
        LICENSEE’S FULL ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS, CONDITIONS, DISCLAIMERS AND LICENSE
        RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. &lt;u&gt;License Grant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: Upon
        payment in full of the license fee, Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive,
        perpetual, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable license, without
        time limitations, to use the Sitecore Software in supported configurations as
        described in the Documentation, in compliance with all applicable laws, in object
        code form only, exclusively for the Permitted Usage (as that term is defined in Exhibit A),
        subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and Exhibits A
        and B hereto, which are incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement.
        Except as expressly authorized by this Agreement, “Licensee” as used herein
        does not include any other entity or person, including any present or future
        subsidiary or affiliate of Licensee, or any entity or person owning any
        interest in Licensee at present or in the future.
        “Sitecore Software” means the software that is licensed by Licensor in this
        Agreement, and any future Upgrades and Patches, as those terms are defined in
        Section 6 of this Agreement, that the Licensee may receive in accordance with
        the terms of the Agreement. “Documentation” means the resources made available
        in the reference section of the Sitecore Developer Network setting forth the
        then-current functional, operational, and performance capabilities of the
        Sitecore Software (http://sdn.sitecore.net/documentation).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin:0 0 10.0pt 21.6pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.1 License Key&lt;/b&gt;: Licensee will be provided a
        License Key that gives Licensee access to the Sitecore Software. The Sitecore
        Software may be used only on the equipment with the features and limitations
        specified in the License Key. The License Key shall be time-limited until full
        payment of the license fee has been received by Licensor. The License Key may
        limit the number of installations of the Sitecore Software and the capacity of
        the Servers on which the Sitecore Software may be installed. For purposes of
        this Agreement, one Server is defined as a physical or virtual Server with a
        processing power for the web process equivalent to at most eight CPU cores. For
        example, one physical Server may contain eight single-core CPUs, four dual-core
        CPUs, two quad-core CPUs or one eight-core CPU. A Server with three or four
        quad-core CPUs would therefore count as two Servers. A virtual server’s processing power will be counted as
        the number of physical cores allocated or processor core equivalents allocated
        to the virtual server. For example, one virtual server with two physical
        processor cores allocated, or with the equivalent of two simulated processor
        cores allocated, would be counted as the equivalent of two CPU cores and
        therefore one Server.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin:0 0 10.0pt 21.6pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.2 Intellectual Property Rights&lt;/b&gt;:
        The Sitecore Software includes the following patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,856,345 and
        8,255,526. Ownership of the Sitecore Software, and all worldwide rights, title and interest in and
        to the Intellectual Property associated with the Sitecore Software shall remain
        solely and exclusively with Licensor or with third parties that license modules
        included with the Sitecore Software. Licensee shall retain intact all
        applicable Licensor copyright, patent and/or trademark notices on and in all
        copies of the Sitecore Software. All rights, title, and interest in Sitecore
        Software not expressly granted to Licensee in this Agreement are reserved by
        Licensor. “Intellectual Property” as used in this Agreement means any and all
        patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and trade names (registered and
        unregistered), trade secrets, know-how, inventions, licenses and all other
        proprietary rights throughout the world related to the authorship, origin,
        design, utility, process, manufacture, programming, functionality and operation
        of Sitecore Software and its Derivative Works.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin:0 0 10.0pt 21.6pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.3 Confidential Information&lt;/b&gt;:
        The term “Confidential Information” shall include any information, whether tangible or
        intangible, including, but not limited to, techniques, discoveries, inventions,
        ideas, processes, software (in source or object code form), designs,
        technology, technical specifications, flow charts, procedures, formulas,
        concepts, any financial data, and all business and marketing plans and
        information, in each case which is maintained in confidence by the disclosing
        party (“Disclosing Party”) and disclosed to the other party (“Recipient”)
        hereunder. The failure by the Disclosing Party to designate any tangible or
        intangible information as Confidential Information shall not give Recipient the
        right to treat such information as free from the restrictions imposed by this Agreement
        if the circumstances would lead a reasonable person to believe that such
        information is Confidential Information. Confidential Information does not
        include information which Recipient documents (a) is now, or hereafter becomes,
        through no act or failure to act on the part of Recipient, generally known or
        available to the public; (b) was rightfully in Recipient’s possession prior to
        disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (c) becomes rightfully known to Recipient,
        without restriction, from a source other than the Disclosing Party and without
        any breach of duty to the Disclosing Party; (d) is developed
        independently by Recipient without use of or reference to any of the
        Confidential Information and without violation of any confidentiality restriction
        contained herein; or (e) is approved by the Disclosing Party for disclosure
        without restriction, in a written document executed by a duly authorized
        officer of the Disclosing Party. Recipient shall hold the Confidential
        Information received from the Disclosing Party in strict confidence and shall
        not, directly or indirectly, disclose it, except as expressly permitted herein.
        Recipient shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party upon learning of any
        misappropriation or misuse of Confidential Information disclosed hereunder.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient shall be permitted to disclose
        Confidential Information pursuant to a judicial or governmental order, provided
        that Recipient provides the Disclosing Party reasonable prior notice, and
        assistance, to contest such order.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin:0 0 10.0pt 21.6pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.4 Restrictions on Use&lt;/b&gt;:
        Except as expressly authorized by applicable
        law or by Licensor in writing, Licensee shall not copy, in whole or in part,
        the Sitecore Software or Documentation, or modify, disassemble, decompress,
        reverse compile, reverse assemble, reverse engineer, or translate any portion
        of the Sitecore Software. Licensee shall not rent, lease, lend, distribute,
        sell, assign, license, or otherwise transfer the Sitecore Software, or create
        Derivative Works of the Sitecore Software. Additionally, Licensee may use
        embedded third-party components in the Sitecore Software exclusively as described in the OEM
        section of the Sitecore Developer Network (&lt;a href="http://sdn.sitecore.net/oem"&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;text-decoration:none'&gt;http://sdn.sitecore.net/oem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin:0 0 10.0pt 21.6pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.5  Derivative Works&lt;/b&gt;:
        “Derivative Works” as used herein means any software program (whether in source code or object code),
        and all copies thereof, developed by or on behalf of Licensee based on or
        derived from any part of the Sitecore Software, including without limitation
        any revision, modification, enhancement, translation (including compilation or
        recapitulation by computer), abridgment, condensation, expansion, or any other
        form in which the Sitecore Software may be recast, transformed or adapted, and
        that, if prepared without Licensor's authorization, would constitute a patent,
        copyright or trade secret infringement of the Sitecore Software, or would
        otherwise constitute an unauthorized use of Licensor’s Confidential Information.
        In the event any such Derivative Works are created, Licensor shall own all
        right, title, and interest in and to such Derivative Works. If, under the
        operation of local law or otherwise, Licensee or such third party comes to have
        any rights associated with such Derivative Works, Licensee hereby and shall
        automatically assign all such rights to Licensor for no additional
        consideration. For avoidance of doubt, Licensor shall claim no intellectual
        property interest or legal interest of any kind in any code created by Licensee
        to facilitate its authorized use of the Sitecore Software so long as the
        creation of such code does not constitute a Derivative Work or violate any other
        provision of this Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin:0 0 10.0pt 21.6pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.6 Third Party Use and Rights&lt;/b&gt;:
        Licensee may authorize third parties to
        assist Licensee in the management, editing, and hosting of web-based content
        created by use of the Sitecore Software, provided that: (1) such activities are
        within the scope of the activities Licensee is itself authorized to perform
        under this Agreement; (2) such third party’s acts are primarily for the direct
        or indirect benefit of Licensee; and (3) such third parties are not charged a
        fee by Licensee for such activities. Licensee is prohibited from using the
        Sitecore Software as an Application Software Provider or in any time-sharing or
        other commercial arrangement of any kind that makes the Sitecore Software
        available to third parties primarily for the third party’s own uses. Except as
        expressly stated in this Agreement, no third party has any rights under this Agreement.
        Licensee is fully liable to the extent allowed by law for any unauthorized use
        of the Sitecore Software by third parties caused by any acts or omissions of
        Licensee.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin:0 0 10.0pt 21.6pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.7 License Verification&lt;/b&gt;:
        The Sitecore Software periodically transmits the following information to a server maintained by
        Licensor: License Key ID, licensee name, hostname (Licensee’s website URL),
        host IP, Sitecore Software version, and directory installation path. This
        information is used by Licensor to send periodic communications to Licensee
        relevant to use of the Sitecore Software, and to verify, at Licensor’s election,
        that the Sitecore Software is installed in accordance with the terms of this
        Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;'&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. &lt;u&gt;Limited Warranties&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin:0 0 10.0pt 22.5pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.1 Licensor’s Limited Warranty&lt;/b&gt;:
        Licensor expressly warrants that the Sitecore Software provided to Licensee
        will work for a period of ninety (90) days following the effective date of this
        Agreement according to the Documentation. In the event any such Sitecore
        Software does not operate according to the Documentation during this Limited
        Warranty Period, Licensor shall repair or replace the Sitecore Software and
        such repair or replacement shall be Licensee’s sole and exclusive remedy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin:0 0 10.0pt 22.5pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.2 Virus/Malicious Code Warranty&lt;/b&gt;:
        Licensor and Licensee warrant that they will use commercially reasonable virus and
        malicious code detection software programs to test any electronic files,
        including electronic communications, prior to any delivery or upon receiving such
        communications and that the parties will continue to take such steps with
        respect to exchanging electronic files and communications pursuant to this
        Agreement. In the event either party detects any computer virus or malicious
        code it shall immediately notify the other party and where possible shall promptly
        provide revised replacement files in the event any such computer virus or
        malicious code is detected.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. &lt;u&gt;DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES&lt;/u&gt;: EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN
        SECTION 2 ABOVE, THE SITECORE SOFTWARE AND THE DOCUMENTATION ARE SUPPLIED TO
        LICENSEE AS IS.” LICENSOR (DEFINED IN THIS SECTION AS LICENSOR’S PARENT,
        AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, DISTRIBUTORS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS
        AND EMPLOYEES) MAKES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE SITECORE
        SOFTWARE, THE DOCUMENTATION, THE OPERATION OF THE SITECORE SOFTWARE, OR ANY
        OTHER GOODS OR SERVICES RENDERED BY LICENSOR TO LICENSEE, INCLUDING BUT NOT
        LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY,
        NON-INFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING
        FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ANY WARRANTIES
        IMPLIED BY LAW CANNOT BE WAIVED. LICENSOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL
        EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES THAT THE SITECORE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
        PROPERLY ON ANY HARDWARE, THAT THE SITECORE SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE’S
        REQUIREMENTS OR OPERATE IN THE COMBINATIONS WHICH MAY BE SELECTED FOR USE BY
        LICENSEE, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SITECORE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED
        OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ALL ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED. LICENSOR MAKES NO EXPRESS
        OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND REGARDING ANY SEPARATELY LICENSED SOFTWARE THAT
        MAY BE USED WITH THE SITECORE SOFTWARE.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. &lt;u&gt;LIMITATION OF LIABILITY&lt;/u&gt;: LICENSOR (DEFINED IN THIS
        SECTION AS LICENSOR’S PARENT, AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, DISTRIBUTORS AND THEIR
        RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE
        OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
        PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT UNDER
        ANY LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA OR
        BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, THE COST OF RECOVERING ANY DATA, INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
        COST OF SUBSTITUTE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF, KNOWS OF, OR
        SHOULD HAVE KNOWN, OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR’S AGGREGATE
        LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FEES (NOT
        INCLUDING MAINTENANCE PROGRAM CHARGES) PAID BY LICENSEE FOR USE OF THE SITECORE
        SOFTWARE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. LICENSOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS OR
        FAILURES IN PERFORMANCE OF THE SUPPORT OR ANY OTHER SERVICES CAUSED BY FORCES
        BEYOND ITS CONTROL OR ANY FORCE MAJEURE EVENT SUCH AS ACT OF TERRORISM, LOSS OF
        POWER, ACT OF GOD, OR SIMILAR OCCURRENCE. THE LIMITATION PROVISIONS OF THIS
        SECTION SHALL BE APPLICABLE TO ANY CLAIM FILED BY LICENSEE ARISING OUT OF OR
        RELATING TO ANY SEPARATELY LICENSED SOFTWARE THAT MAY BE USED WITH THE SITECORE
        SOFTWARE.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. &lt;u&gt;Sitecore Maintenance Program&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:
        Licensee will automatically be enrolled in the Sitecore Maintenance Program.
        For each Maintenance Program Period (as that term is defined in Exhibit A)
        Licensee will be charged a non-refundable Maintenance Program Charge (as that
        term is defined in Exhibit A). The Sitecore Maintenance Program includes
        Upgrades and support. Upgrades are free of charge for as long as Licensee
        is enrolled in the Maintenance Program. Three years after the date of the
        initial purchase and each three-year anniversary thereafter, Licensor may adjust
        the Maintenance Program Charge then in effect for all software purchased under
        this Agreement to 20% of the Licensor’s then-current retail prices. Licensee
        may cancel the Maintenance Program by providing Licensor with 60 days’ notice
        prior to the end of any Maintenance Program Period. Licensor may cancel
        the Maintenance Program upon Licensee’s failure to pay timely any applicable
        Maintenance Program Charge. A cancelled Maintenance Program may not be renewed
        except upon payment of double the amount of fees that would have been paid
        during the lapsed period.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. &lt;u&gt;Upgrades and Patches of Sitecore Software&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:
        “Patch” as used in this Agreement means a specific, targeted fix to a discrete problem in the use or
        functionality of the Sitecore Software that Licensor in its sole discretion
        defines to constitute a “Patch” and may from time to time provide to Licensee.
        “Upgrade” as used in this Agreement means a new version of some or all of the
        Sitecore Software, or an improvement in the use or functionality of the Sitecore
        Software more substantial than a Patch, that Licensor in its sole discretion
        defines to constitute an “Upgrade” and may from time to time provide to
        Licensees enrolled in the Sitecore Maintenance program. Licensee expressly
        acknowledges that Upgrades and Patches may change functionality of the Sitecore
        Software and integration with other systems, and may not work with some or all
        of the Sitecore Software modules, or be backward compatible with earlier
        versions of Sitecore Software. Installation of Patches and Upgrades is the
        choice and responsibility of Licensee. To the extent that operation of the Sitecore
        Software is affected by problems in standard software, including, but not
        limited to, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Windows and the Microsoft.Net
        Framework, then Licensee shall install updates to such standard software per
        Licensor’s specifications in order to resolve these issues. Licensor has no
        control over such standard software, and cannot assure that problems with such
        standard software will be corrected, or that such corrections will be made in a
        timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. &lt;u&gt;Waivers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:
        All waivers must be in writing and signed by authorized representatives of the parties. Any waiver or failure to enforce
        any provision of this Agreement on one occasion shall not be deemed a waiver of
        any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. &lt;u&gt;Severability&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:
        If any provision of this Agreement is adjudicated to be unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed changed and
        interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest
        extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions shall
        continue in full force and effect.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. &lt;u&gt;Assignment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:
        Licensee may not assign this Agreement,
        by operation of law or otherwise, which includes any change of control in the
        ownership structure of Licensee. Licensor may assign this Agreement to a
        successor (whether by merger, a sale of all or a significant portion of its
        assets, a sale of a controlling interest of its capital stock, or otherwise)
        that agrees to assume Licensor’s obligations under this Agreement. Any
        attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Section shall be void and
        of no force or effect. Subject to the provisions of this Section 9, this
        Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the parties.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:10.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify'&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. &lt;u&gt;Entire Agreement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:
        This Agreement, and any attachment that is expressly incorporated in this Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement
        between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
        prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings and communications, whether
        written or oral. This Agreement may be amended only by a written document
        signed by both parties. In the event of a conflict between any provision of
        this Agreement with any other attachment or document, this Agreement shall
        control. Any term or condition not specifically authorized
        by this Agreement included in any Licensee invoice, purchase order or other
        document rendered pursuant to this Agreement is of no force or effect unless
        the specific term or condition has been previously agreed to by the parties in
        writing in a separate agreement. No action by Licensor (including, without
        limitation, receipt of payment of any such invoice, or acceptance of any
        purchase order, in whole or in part) shall be construed as making any such term
        or condition binding on Licensor.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p style='font-size:8.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;text-align:justify'&gt;Sitecore License Agreement. July 1, 2013&lt;/p&gt;

==========================================================
    BEFORE YOU CLICK NEXT:
    - Ensure you have installed and configured the Sitecore Publishing Service (this module only enables integration with the service)
        Documentation detailing how to install the service is available seperately.

        [Warning] This module will not work without a properly configured service instance.  No items will be able to be published.
    
    AFTER YOU CLOSE THE WIZARD:
    After the package is installed, follow these steps to complete the Sitecore Publishing Module installation:
    - Configure the service endpoints:
        Add a configuration file which overrides the 'PublishingServiceUrlRoot' setting to point to your service module        
        Make sure the address contains a trailing slash
        e.g.
            &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
            &lt;configuration xmlns:patch="http://www.sitecore.net/xmlconfig/"&gt;
              &lt;sitecore&gt;
                &lt;settings&gt;
                  &lt;setting name="PublishingServiceUrlRoot"&gt;http://sitecore.publishing/&lt;/setting&gt;
                &lt;/settings&gt;    
              &lt;/sitecore&gt;
            &lt;/configuration&gt;
    - Configure the Content Delivery Servers:
